A resident of the White Mountains as far back as 1987 when Joe Garbeil took the grooming director’s position at the <em>Sunrise Ski Area</em>. He had also been working in  the snowy Mountains of Australia. In 1992 while vacationing in Thailand, he met his wife Noy, a native to Northern Thailand. She came to the U.S. for the first time in 1996 on a fiancé visa and they married  in 1997. Although Noi  loved this area …she did not care for living at the Ski Resort while Joe worked. She worked at the Sunrise hotel restaurant in the kitchen as prep cook. Her dream was to open a business, and since there were certainly no Thai restaurants on the Mountain at that time, and Joe knew that she was an excellent Thai chef, it seemed natural that this was their destiny.

Joe wasn’t as confident as Noy that her idea of a Thai restaurant in the White Mountains would be a success, but he certainly knew that she could cook delicious and authentic Thai cuisine, and he wanted to support his wife who was so far from the only home she had ever known. So they opened their first restaurant near the Pinetop Post Office in April 1999.

Almost twenty years later, Mountain Thai Restaurant and Joe and Noy Garbeil are still going strong. Noy still does all of the cooking with a bit of kitchen help, and you will find Joe eager to greet you at the door.

They enjoy serving food that is authentic as it gets, and the locals clearly enjoy it or they would not have been able to thrive in such a small community all these years.

The homemade Deep Fried egg rolls , Summer rolls (rice paper wraps) and the Vietnamese style Pho are exceptional….There are  many other tasty  things on the menu including  the Roast Duck, Drunken Noodles, 5 uniquely different kinds of Curry.Tom Yum Gung , andTom Ka Gai which are favorites  among many, and  the homemade coconut ice cream that Joe makes himself. The Sticky Rice with fresh mango dessert should not be missed either.
