<div class="aboutMTtext container">
<p>Owners Joe and Noy Garbeil have called the White Mountains home for many years. In 1987, Joe took a job as grooming director at the Sunrise Ski Area, where he continued to work for many seasons. In 1992, Joe met Noy while vacationing in Thailand, and in 1996 Noy moved permanently to the Lakeside area. 
</p><p>
Joe and Noy opened their first Mountain Thai Restaurant near the Lakeside Post Office in 1999.  After a few years of success at that location, they built their current restaurant around 2006 and have been going strong ever since.
 </p><p>   
With Noy's passion for cooking and talent for developing delicious Thai dishes combined with Joe's business sense, Mountain Thai has become an icon in the Lakeside area. While Noy runs the kitchen, Joe manages the bar and restaurant. 
    </p>
<p>So stop by and enjoy some tasty Thai food and drinks in the casual and friendly atmosphere of Mountain Thai.
