<div class="aboutMTtext container">
<p>Owners Joe and Noi Garbeil have called the White Mountains home for many years. In 1987, Joe took a job as grooming director at the Sunrise Ski Area, where he continued to work for many seasons. In 1992, Joe met Noi while vacationing in Thailand, and in 1996 Noi moved permanently to the Lakeside area. 
</p><p>
Joe and Noi opened their first Mountain Thai Restaurant near the Lakeside Post Office in 1999.  After a few years of success at that location, they built their current restaurant around 2006 and have been going strong ever since.
 </p><p>   
With Noi's passion for cooking and talent for developing delicious Thai dishes combined with Joe's business sense, Mountain Thai has become an icon in the Lakeside area. While Noi runs the kitchen, Joe manages the bar and restaurant. 
    </p>
<p>So stop by and enjoy some tasty Thai food and drinks in the casual and friendly atmosphere of Mountain Thai.
