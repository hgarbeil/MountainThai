If you find yourself in the White Mountains of Arizona with an appetite for authentic Thai cuisine, you have come to the right place.</p>
<p>
Serving the Lakeside community for over 23 years, Mountain Thai is well known and loved by residents and visitors alike. The flavorful and varied dishes are prepared by co-owner and cook Noy Garbeil, a northern Thai native with a talent for creating tasty and authentic Thai food. 
</p>
<p>
So stop by Mountain Thai for an extraordinary meal and the casual, friendly atmosphere nurtured by Noy and her husband Joe. In addition to an extensive food menu, we also offer a full selection of Asian and domestic beers (both tap and bottled), cocktails, and wine. 
</p><p>
We also carry various Asian market items such as curry pastes, rice noodles, bean thread noodles, Sriracha, sweet chili sauce, Thai tea and coffee, tamarind, kaffir lime, lemon grass, boba, rice paper wrappers, coconut milk, and more.
